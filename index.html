        <p class="message large">
            People are like diaries. When we allow someone to talk with us and let it affect us,
            we are basically allowing them to write on our pages.

            Some write carelessly and leave messy lines behind.
            Some draw small doodles that make us smile.
            Some write good things and some write hard things.
            That’s just life.

            You chose to let me write on your diary.
            I wrote a lot, and honestly it was a beautiful experience for me.

            But after some time, you kept trusting me enough to let me write anything,
            and I took that for granted.
            I didn’t realize how careful I should have been, and I messed things up.

            I tried to fix it by apologizing, but sometimes apologies don’t fix the page —
            they only show how damaged it became.

            Now your diary is closed, and I finally understand how precious it was.
            I’m not writing this to change your decision or ask for anything.
            I just wanted to acknowledge it honestly.

            Whatever you choose now, I respect it.
            Thank you for the pages you let me be part of.
        </p>

        <p class="small-message">That’s all I wanted to say.</p>
